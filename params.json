  "body": "# Overview\r\nThe **ex**tra-**ce**llular **R**NA **p**rocessing **t**oolkit (**exceRpt**) was designed to handle the variable contamination and often poor quality data obtained from low input **smallRNA-seq** samples such as those obtained from **extra-cellular** preparations.  However the tool is perfectly capable of processing data from more standard **cellular** preparations and, with minor modifications to the command-line call, is also capable of processing **WGS/exome** and **long RNA-seq** data.\r\n\r\nThe schematic diagram below details the various stages of the exceRpt pipeline including **pre-processing** of the raw reads, **contaminant removal**, alignment to the **endogenous** (human/mouse) genome and annotated transcriptome, and finally alignment to a large number of **exogenous** sequences for detection of foreign nucleic acids.\r\n\r\n![exceRpt workflow diagram](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2696693/exceRpt_workflow.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n# How to use exceRpt\r\n## Genboree.org\r\nSigning up for an account on [Genboree.org](http://genboree.org) is by far the fastest way to start using exceRpt.  The Genboree Workbench provides a graphical interface to exceRpt that is free for academic use.  Set up a free account to use the [Genboree Workbench](http://genboree.org/java-bin/login.jsp), upload some data, and start using exceRpt, all via the browser ([instructions available here](http://genboree.org/theCommons/projects/exrna-tools-may2014/wiki/Small%20RNA-seq%20Pipeline)).\r\n\r\n## Docker\r\nSlightly more effort to get set up than using Genboree, but using the [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image is the best way to use exceRpt on your own machine/cluster.  The [exceRpt Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rkitchen/excerpt) is pre-baked with all required dependencies and should 'just work' with minimal installation.  Docker is native on Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions (RHEL) and also available on Amazon, enabling exceRpt to be run in the cloud.  Instructions are available for installing Docker on [Mac OS X](http://docs.docker.com/mac/started), [Linux](http://docs.docker.com/linux/started), [Windows](http://docs.docker.com/windows/started), and [Amazon Web Services](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html). \r\n\r\n**BEWARE**, exceRpt requires about **16GB of RAM** in order to function properly, runs on machines with less than this amount of available memory will very likely fail.  If running Docker inside a virtual machine (such as via VirtualBox on Mac OS X) it is **important to check that the VM has been initialised with at least 16GB of memory**.  This is usually a setting that can be modified as long as the VM is not currently running.\r\n\r\nAs with the manual installation described below, **you will also need to download the pre-compiled genome and transcriptome indices** for exceRpt to use.  These are too large to be included in the Docker image, but using these links you can download the exceRpt database files:\r\n\r\n* [human hg19](http://homes.gersteinlab.org/people/rrk24/exceRpt/exceRptDB_v4_hg19_lowmem.tgz); \r\n* [human hg38](http://homes.gersteinlab.org/people/rrk24/exceRpt/exceRptDB_v4_hg38_lowmem.tgz);\r\n* [mouse mm10](http://homes.gersteinlab.org/people/rrk24/exceRpt/exceRptDB_v4_mm10_lowmem.tgz).\r\n\r\nOnce you have downloaded the desired genome database and have successfully installed and started Docker on your machine/cluster/AWS-instance only a few commands are required to install and run exceRpt.  \r\n\r\nTo download the exceRpt Docker image, type:\r\n\r\n    docker pull rkitchen/excerpt\r\n\r\nTo download the exceRpt database for your genome/species of interest (currently one of hg19, hg39, or mm10) use the following commands.  Here we'll download the latest build of the human genome and transcriptome (hg38):\r\n\r\n    mkdir ~/DirectoryContainingMyexceRptDatabase\r\n    cd ~/DirectoryContainingMyexceRptDatabase\r\n    wget http://homes.gersteinlab.org/people/rrk24/exceRpt/exceRptDB_hg38.tgz\r\n    tar -xvf exceRptDB_hg38.tgz\r\n\r\nTo run a smallRNA-seq sample through the exceRpt pipeline we can grab a publicly-available dataset from the SRA:\r\n\r\n    mkdir ~/DirectoryContainingMyInputSample\r\n    cd ~/DirectoryContainingMyInputSample\r\n    wget ftp://ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/dra/sralite/ByExp/litesra/SRX/SRX010/SRX010851/SRR026761/SRR026761.sra\r\n\r\nAlmost done, just need to make sure there is a directory in which to put the exceRpt pipeline output:\r\n\r\n    mkdir ~/DirectoryInWhichToPutMyResults\r\n\r\nFinally, we can input this sample to the exceRpt pipeline, aligning to the hg38 genome+transcriptome we just downloaded:\r\n\r\n    docker run -v ~/DirectoryContainingMyInputSample:/exceRptInput \\\r\n               -v ~/DirectoryInWhichToPutMyResults:/exceRptOutput \\\r\n               -v ~/DirectoryContainingMyexceRptDatabase/hg38:/exceRpt_DB/hg38 \\\r\n               -t rkitchen/excerpt \\\r\n               INPUT_FILE_PATH=/exceRptInput/SRR026761.sra\r\n\r\nMost of the Docker command is loading directories on your machine (the `-v` parameters) so that exceRpt can read from or write to them.  The directory to the left of each `:` can obviously be whatever you want, but it is important to make sure the right side of each `:` is written as above or exceRpt will not be able to find/write the data it needs.\r\n\r\nThe last line of the `docker run` command (`INPUT_FILE_PATH=`) is a direct call to exceRpt itself.  As such, any customisable options should be specified this way.  For example we could re-order the priority of the transcriptome libraries (for example if we expected a sample to have more long-RNA fragments than miRNAs) using the following call to docker:\r\n\r\n    docker run -v ~/DirectoryContainingMyInputSample:/exceRptInput \\\r\n               -v ~/DirectoryInWhichToPutMyResults:/exceRptOutput \\\r\n               -v ~/DirectoryContainingMyexceRptDatabase/hg38:/exceRpt_DB/hg38 \\\r\n               -t rkitchen/excerpt \\\r\n               INPUT_FILE_PATH=/exceRptInput/SRR026761.sra \\\r\n               ENDOGENOUS_LIB_PRIORITY=gencode,miRNA,tRNA,piRNA,circRNA\r\n\r\nWe can also use this approach to change the genome to which we are aligning (for example, change to mouse mm10) \r\n\r\n    docker run -v ~/DirectoryContainingMyInputSample:/exceRptInput \\\r\n               -v ~/DirectoryInWhichToPutMyResults:/exceRptOutput \\\r\n               -v ~/DirectoryContainingMyexceRptDatabase/mm10:/exceRpt_DB/mm10 \\\r\n               -t rkitchen/excerpt \\\r\n               INPUT_FILE_PATH=/exceRptInput/SRR026761.sra \\\r\n               MAIN_ORGANISM_GENOME_ID=mm10\r\n\r\nFinally, if you're lucky enough to have an abundance of available disk space, it is easier in the long run to pass Docker the directory containing all available exceRpt genome databases so that to change organism/genome only the `MAIN_ORGANISM_GENOME_ID` variable needs to be modified:\r\n\r\n    docker run -v ~/DirectoryContainingMyInputSample:/exceRptInput \\\r\n               -v ~/DirectoryInWhichToPutMyResults:/exceRptOutput \\\r\n               -v ~/DirectoryContainingMyexceRptDatabase:/exceRpt_DB \\\r\n               -t rkitchen/excerpt \\\r\n               INPUT_FILE_PATH=/exceRptInput/SRR026761.sra \\\r\n               MAIN_ORGANISM_GENOME_ID=mm10 \\\r\n               [OPTION]=[VALUE]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Analysis customisation options\r\nThere are a number of options available for customising the analysis that are specified using the command-line.  These are a list of the most commonly-modified options and their default values.\r\n\r\n*Required* OPTIONs:\r\n\r\n    INPUT_FILE_PATH                  | Path to the input fastq/fasta/sra file\r\n\r\n\r\nMain analysis OPTIONs:\r\n\r\n    ADAPTER_SEQ                      | 'guessKnown'/'none'/<String>     | [default: 'guessKnown'] will attempt to guess the 3 adapter using known sequences.

Generally not recommended unless you are very familiar with the *NIX environment, shell scripting, and makefile syntax.  Detailed instructions on how to install exceRpt and its various dependencies will [one day] be listed toward the bottom of this page.\r\n\r\nOnce all dependencies are installed, the exceRpt pipeline can be run on a human sample (here an SRA binary file) using default parameters using the following skeleton command:\r\n\r\n    make -f exceRpt_smallRNA \\\r\n        INPUT_FILE_PATH=~/DirectoryContainingMyInputSample/SRR026761.sra \\\r\n        OUTPUT_DIR=~/DirectoryInWhichToPutMyResults\r\n\r\nIt is important to properly configure the makefile for this to work.  It is probably a good idea to get in touch with the maintainers using the email address listed at the bottom of the page before embarking on this yourself!\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Understanding the exceRpt output contained in OUTPUT_DIR\r\n\r\nA variety of output files are created for each sample as they are run through the exceRpt pipeline.  At the highest level, 5 files and one directory are output to the OUTPUT_DIR:\r\n\r\n    [sampleID]/                    | Directory containing the complete set of output files for this sample\r\n    [sampleID]_CORE_RESULTS_v*.tgz | Archive containing only the most commonly used results for this sample\r\n    [sampleID].err                 | Text file containing error logging information for this run\r\n    [sampleID].log                 | Text file containing normal logging information for this run\r\n    [sampleID].qcResult            | Text file containing a variety of QC metrics for this sample\r\n    [sampleID].stats               | Text file containing a variety of alignment statistics for this sample\r\n\r\n\r\n## [sampleID]_CORE_RESULTS_v4.*.tgz\r\n\r\nThis archive contains the **most commonly used results** for this sample and is the only file required to run the mergePipelineRuns.R script described below for processing the output from multiple runs of the exceRpt pipeline (i.e. for multiple samples).  The contents of this archive are as follows:\r\n\r\n    [sampleID].log                                   | Same as above\r\n    [sampleID].stats                                 | Same as above\r\n    [sampleID].qcResult                              | Same as above\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].readCounts_*_sense.txt     | Read counts of each annotated RNA using sense alignments\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].readCounts_*_antisense.txt | Read counts of each annotated RNA using antisense alignments\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].*.coverage.txt             | Contains read-depth across all gencode transcripts\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].*.CIGARstats.txt           | Summary of the alignment characteristics for genome-mapped reads\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].*_fastqc.zip               | FastQC output both before and after UniVec/rRNA contaminant removal\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].*.readLengths.txt          | Counts of the number of reads of each length following adapter removal\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].*.counts                   | Read counts mapped to UniVec & rRNA (and calibrator oligo, if used) sequences\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].*.knownAdapterSeq          | 3' adapter sequence guessed (from known adapters) in this sample\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].*.adapterSeq               | 3' adapter used to clip the reads in this run\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].*.qualityEncoding          | PHRED encoding guessed for the input sequence reads \r\n\r\n\r\n## [sampleID]/\r\n\r\nThe main results directory contains all files above as well as the following:\r\n\r\nIntermediate files containing reads 'surviving' each stage, in the following order of 1) 3' adapter clipping, 2) 5'/3' end trimming, 3) read-quality and homopolymer filtering, 4) UniVec contaminant removal, and 5) rRNA removal:\r\n\r\n    [sampleID]/[sampleID].*.fastq.gz | Reads remaining after each QC / filtering / alignment step\r\n\r\n\r\nReads aligned at each step of the pipeline in the following order 1) UniVec, 2) rRNA, 3) endogenous genome, 4) endogenous transcriptome:\r\n\r\n    [sampleID]/filteringAlignments_*.bam                              | Alignments to the UniVec and rRNA sequences\r\n    [sampleID]/endogenousAlignments_genome*.bam                       | Alignments (ungapped) to the endogenous genome\r\n    [sampleID]/endogenousAlignments_genomeMapped_transcriptome*.bam   | Transcriptome alignments (ungapped) of reads mapped to the genome\r\n    [sampleID]/endogenousAlignments_genomeUnmapped_transcriptome*.bam | Transcriptome alignments (ungapped) of reads **not** mapped to the genome\r\n\r\n\r\nAlignment summary information obtained after invoking the library priority.  In the default setting, this will choose a miRBase alignment over any other alignment, for example if it is aligned to both a miRNA in miRBase and a miRNA in Gencode, the miRBase alignment is kept and all others discarded.  It is especially important for tRNAs to be chosen in favour of piRNAs, as the latter have quite a large number of mis-annotations to the former.\r\n\r\n    [sampleID]/endogenousAlignments_Accepted.txt.gz | All compatible alignments against the transcriptome after invoking the library priority\r\n    [sampleID]/endogenousAlignments_Accepted.dict   | Contains the ID(s) of the RNA annotations indexed in the fifth column of the .txt.gz file above\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the quantifications are stored in the various readCounts_*.txt files.  The format of these tab-delimited files is as follows:\r\n\r\n    ReferenceID                                         uniqueReadCount totalReadCount multimapAdjustedReadCount multimapAdjustedBarcodeCount\r\n    hsa-miR-143-3p:MIMAT0000435:Homo:sapiens:miR-143-3p\t1235            4147219        4147219.0\t        0.0\r\n    hsa-miR-10b-5p:MIMAT0000254:Homo:sapiens:miR-10b-5p\t1430            2420500        2420241.0\t        0.0\r\n    hsa-miR-10a-5p:MIMAT0000253:Homo:sapiens:miR-10a-5p\t1115            784863         784600.5\t                0.0\r\n    hsa-miR-192-5p:MIMAT0000222:Homo:sapiens:miR-192-5p\t759             559068         558542.5\t                0.0\r\n\r\nWhere `ReferenceID` is the **ID of this annotated RNA**, `uniqueReadCount` is the **number of unique insert sequences** attributed to this annotated RNA, `totalReadCount` is the **total number of reads** attributable to this annotated RNA, `multimapAdjustedReadCount` is the **count after adjusting for multi-mapped reads**, and `multimapAdjustedBarcodeCount` (available only for samples prepped with randomly barcoded 5' and/or 3' adapters such as Bioo) is the number of **unique N-mer barcodes** adjusted for multimapping ambiguity in the insert sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Processing exceRpt output from multiple samples\r\nAlso provided is a script to combine output from multiple samples run through the exceRpt pipeline.  The script (`mergePipelineRuns.R`) will take as input a directory containing 1 or more subdirectories or zipfiles containing output from the makefile above. In this way, results from 1 or more smallRNA-seq samples can be combined, several QC plots are generated, and the read-counts are normalised ready for downstream analysis by clustering and/or differential expression.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThis script is comparatively much simpler to install.  Once the R software (http://cran.r-project.org/) is set up on your system the script should automatically identify and install all required dependencies.  Again, this script is available on the Genboree Workbench (www.genboree.org) and is also free for academic use.\r\n\r\n## Using the script\r\n### On the command line\r\nThe Rscript application provides a neat means of running the script:\r\n\r\n    Rscript mergePipelineRuns.R ~/DirectoryContainingMyexceRptRuns\r\n\r\nHere, the directory in which the script will search for valid exceRpt output (`~/DirectoryContainingMyexceRptRuns`) should be the same as the (`~/DirectoryInWhichToPutMyResults`) specific when running each sample through exceRpt.\r\n\r\n### Interactively in R \r\nAlternatively in an interactive R session, the merge can be performed using the following two commands:\r\n\r\n    > source(\"mergePipelineRuns_functions.R\")\r\n    > processSamplesInDir(data.dir, output.dir)\r\n\r\nApart from some status messages, warnings, or possibly errors, no R objects are output from this function.  Instead several files are created that are described immediately below...\r\n\r\n## Script output\r\nSeveral files are output by the script in the location of the input exceRpt results (or somewhere else if explicitly specified).  All output files are prefixed with 'exceRpt_' and contain a variety of information regarding all samples input:\r\n\r\nFile Name | Description\r\n------------ | -------------\r\n**QC data:** | \r\n`exceRpt_DiagnosticPlots.pdf` | All **diagnostic plots** automatically generated by the merge script\r\n`exceRpt_readMappingSummary.txt` | **Read-alignment summary** including total counts for each library\r\n`exceRpt_ReadLengths.txt` | **Read-lengths** (after 3' adapters/barcodes are removed)\r\n**Raw transcriptome quantifications:** | \r\n`exceRpt_miRNA_ReadCounts.txt` | **miRNA** read-counts quantifications\r\n`exceRpt_tRNA_ReadCounts.txt` | **tRNA** read-counts quantifications\r\n`exceRpt_piRNA_ReadCounts.txt` | **piRNA** read-counts quantifications\r\n`exceRpt_gencode_ReadCounts.txt` | **gencode** read-counts quantifications\r\n`exceRpt_circularRNA_ReadCounts.txt` | **circularRNA** read-count quantifications\r\n**Normalised transcriptome quantifications:** | \r\n`exceRpt_miRNA_ReadsPerMillion.txt` | **miRNA** RPM quantifications\r\n`exceRpt_tRNA_ReadsPerMillion.txt` | **tRNA** RPM quantifications\r\n`exceRpt_piRNA_ReadsPerMillion.txt` | **piRNA** RPM quantifications\r\n`exceRpt_gencode_ReadsPerMillion.txt` | **gencode** RPM quantifications\r\n`exceRpt_circularRNA_ReadsPerMillion.txt` | **circularRNA** RPM quantifications\r\n**R objects:** | \r\n`exceRpt_smallRNAQuants_ReadCounts.RData` | **All raw data** (binary R object)\r\n`exceRpt_smallRNAQuants_ReadsPerMillion.RData` | **All normalised data** (binary R object)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n# Manual Installation\r\n## Dependencies\r\n### Core dependencies\r\n* [Java v1.6+](https://java.com/en/download)\r\n* [fastx v0.0.14+](http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit)\r\n* [STAR v2.4.2a+](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/releases) - required for most exogenous alignments\r\n* [bowtie2 v2.2.4+](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)\r\n* [samtools v1.3+](http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools)\r\n* [fastQC v0.11.2+](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc)\r\n\r\n### Optional dependencies\r\n* [sratoolkit v2.5.1+](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools) - required for processing .sra files from NCBI archival data\r\n\r\n## Installation steps (incomplete)\r\n1.
